## Fibonacci Sequence

*The Fibonacci Sequence* (named after an Italian mathmatician of the same name) is a sequence of numbers, which is expanded by adding the two previous numbers together.

For example, by adding **0** and **1**, you get **1**. 
Adding **1** and **2** will give you **3**. 
**2** and **3** equal to **5**, and so on. 

Eventually, the list will come out to look like this:

**0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc...**

The fourmula used to make the Fibonacci Sequence:

#### **Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2**
